"Guess my number" is an easy game to grasp. I think of a number, you guess it. You can only ask closed yes or no questions. So where do you start? You could just guess randomly, but that seems inefficient - could you improve on that? Write the algorithm so that anyone could follow your exact steps and win any game of "Guess my number".
